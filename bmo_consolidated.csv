2019-09-10,BKD,0,you didn't tell me exactly when you'd be calling or what number you'd be calling from. this is really tiring and frustrating. @bmo . this is after sending me a letter with incorrect information.

2019-09-10,BKD,0,i'm really disappointed in @bmo 's idea of security. how will you call me and ask me for my 16 digit number on my card when any scammer can pretend to be your bank and get my number. you are to ask me security questions and specific numbers. this is not good security at all.

2019-03-06,Carl,0,@bmo basically by continuing to do this you allow scammers to make those calls. a bmo senior vp acknowledged as much when i complained about this last year. the fact that you know this is bad and continue anyway should be criminal ignorance
2019-03-06,Carl,0,@bmo this is a known harm and a responsible financial institution would follow these practices. not doing so is perpetuating a security breach and harming those who do not know better than to never call a number back to discuss finances
2019-03-06,Carl,0,that did not address the fundamental security flaw in this. what if someone pretends to be bmo and gives anther number? doing so may 'help' clients in the short term but actually harms them as a group.
2019-03-06,Carl,0,@bmo its cra scam season. you are aiding and abetting these scammers. the amount of ignorance it takes to persist in this policy should be criminal as it's predatory on those who do not know better
2019-03-06,Carl,0,"@bmo stop perpetuating identity theft, it's highly unethical that you are not following best security practices. how many times do you have to be told stop leaving messages with call-back numbers. have clients call the number on the back of their card with an extension."
